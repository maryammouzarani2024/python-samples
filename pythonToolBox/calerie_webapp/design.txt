Title: Calerie Calculator
Description: an application that gets the user's weight, height, age, city and country
and scrapes the web for daily temperature at the user's location and calculates the required
amount of calerie by the user.


Since we do not need to store a record of users we do not need a user class.
we also do not need a specific behavior of users.

So the classes we need are:

CalerieCalculator:
        weight
        height
        age
        temperature
        calculate()

TemperatureScraper:
    country
    city
    get()
